#+title: MarkovBot

A Telegram bot that trains a markov chain on your group chat.

** Running
- Clone the repository and configure the bot in ~config/config.exs~.

** Training the bot on a Telegram export

The ~MarkovBot.Utilities~ module contains a helper function that trains the bot on a JSON Telegram export.

#+NAME: Start an iex session
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
iex -S mix # Start an iex session along with the bot
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: Train the chain on an export
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir

# NOTE: in case you wish to return to the previous state of the chain,
# you can use a named backup, since they will not get purged
MarkovBot.Scheduler.Tasks.backup("backup_name")

MarkovBot.Utilities.train_from_telegram("path/to/file.json") # relative paths can be used

MarkovBot.Scheduler.Tasks.autosave # force an auto-save to write the updated chain to disk
#+END_SRC

** Updating the configuration at runtime

You can update the config at runtime with built-in Elixir utilities from the ~Application~ module,
but be aware it will not write your changes into ~config/config.exs~,
in order to make your changes persistent you will have to edit it manually.

#+NAME: Updating the configuration during runtime
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
Application.put_env(:markov_bot, :admins, [ 12345 ]) # overwrite the list of admins
#+END_SRC

** Defaults

By default the built-in cron service will auto-save the chain to disk every 15 minutes,
create a backup every day, and purge old backups every week (which are kept for 7 days by default)
